# Data-visualization-examples

In this code I have explained following things:
1. Simple Graph for a input features using Pandas plot() and interpretations.  
2. Box plot and DBScan Clustering to find outliers.

In statistics, outliers are data points that donâ€™t belong to a certain population. It is an abnormal observation that lies far away from other values. An outlier is an observation that diverges from otherwise well-structured data.
